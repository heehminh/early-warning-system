1,Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods on 1 August 2022Press ,2022년 8월 1일에 소비세에 상응하는 상품에 대한 관세율 색인,2022년 7월 28일 게시,"Australian Customs Notice No. 2022/35 Indexation of customs duty rates on excise-equivalent goods on 1 August 2022 This notice sets out the new customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, including spirits, beers and fuel products, operative from 1 August 2022. Section 19 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Customs Tariff Act) provides for customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods to be indexed biannually, in February and August, to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The new rates are determined by the application of an indexation factor. This indexation factor is calculated by dividing the most recent June or December Quarter CPI number by the previous highest June or December Quarter CPI number occurring after the June 1983 Quarter. The December 2021 Quarter CPI figure (121.3) will be used to determine the indexation factor for the duty rate increase applied on 1 August 2022, as it is higher than the previously used June 2021 Quarter CPI figure (refer to ACN 2022/05). On 27 July 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June 2022 Quarter CPI figure (126.1). The figures used to calculate the indexation factor for August 2022 are set out in the table below: Most recent CPI number Highest previous June or December Quarter June Quarter 2022 December Quarter 2021 Indexation Factor 126.1 121.3 1.040 As the indexation factor for August 2022 (1.040) is greater than one, customs duty rates for certain excise-equivalent goods, in Schedule 3 of the Customs Tariff, will increase by the application of this factor. The rates of customs duty for excise-equivalent goods, operative from 1 August 2022, are set out in Table 1 below and supersede the rates outlined in Australian Customs Notice 2022/05. The rates referenced above also apply to goods subject to indexation in:  Schedule 4A (Singaporean originating goods)  Schedule 5 (US originating goods)  Schedule 6 (Thai originating goods)  Schedule 6A (Peruvian originating goods)  Schedule 7 (Chilean originating goods) Australia’s customs service  Schedule 8 (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand originating goods)  Schedule 8A (Pacific Island originating goods)  Schedule 8B (Trans-Pacific Partnership originating goods)  Schedule 9 (Malaysian originating goods)  Schedule 9A (Indonesian originating goods)  Schedule 10 (Korean originating goods)  Schedule 11 (Japanese originating goods)  Schedule 12 (Chinese originating goods)  Schedule 13 (Hong Kong originating goods), and  Schedule 14 (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership originating goods) in the Customs Tariff Act. The Australian Border Force (ABF) will arrange for the publication of a Notice of Substituted Rates of Customs Duty for Excise-Equivalent Goods (No. 3) 2022 in the Gazette. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will make equivalent changes to the rates of duty on goods subject to excise. Further information can be found on the ATO website via the following links: ato.gov.au/alcoholexciserates and ato.gov.au/fuelexciserates. Fuel duty rates – 1 August 2022 to 28 September 2022 The indexation arrangements outlined above apply to all tariff subheadings listed in section 19AAC, including those that have been temporarily reduced consistent with the provisions of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Act 2022. The excise-equivalent customs duty rates outlined in the last four rows of Table 1 apply for the period 1 August 2022 to 28 September 2022.
